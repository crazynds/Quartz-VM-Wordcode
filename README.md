# Quartz-VM-Wordcode

Light virtual machine with a focus on performance and low-level execution of programs using its own binary code named 'Wordcode'.
In its advantages compared to existing languages or even established virtual machines you can highlight:
- Performance superior to interpreted and hybrid languages.
- High dynamics comparable to high-level languages.
- High hardware control (registers, cache, instructions, customized interruptions, etc.)
- Assembly-like language (NASM syntax)
- Modularization of commands to be executed, making the code smaller and more optimized as the VM grows.
  - Standardized opcodes, thus keeping codes from previous versions compatible with new versions of Quartz.
